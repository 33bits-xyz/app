            <br/>
            <p>
                33bits is an MVP for pseudo-anonymous posting on Farcaster, 
                using an 'early' fid as a basic reputation signal. 
                This app is designed to encourage open dialogue in the pursuit of truth. 
                Its utility is dual-edged: it can either cultivate meaningful conversations or descend into toxicity. 
                The choice is ours.
            </p>
